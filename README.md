# Glossary
Consent management is a system, process, or set of policies for collecting and configuring users' permission to collect, process, and store data from a variety of interfaces such as web, mobile apps, and in-person. Consent management is important for both users and companies. Here are some reasons why:
## For users:
- Control over their personal data: Consent management gives users control over their personal data by allowing them to choose what data they want to share with a company and how it can be used.
- Transparency: Consent management ensures that users are informed about how their data will be used and who will have access to it.
- Compliance with privacy regulations: Consent management helps companies comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and others, which require companies to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data.

## For companies:
- Avoidance of regulatory fines: Consent management helps companies avoid regulatory fines by ensuring that they collect and process data only with the appropriate consent.
Increased brand value and customer loyalty: With consent management at the core of the marketing strategy, companies can increase brand value and boost customer loyalty.
- Trust and transparency: Consent management helps companies build trust and transparency with their customers by being transparent about how their data will be used and who will have access to it.
- Compliance with privacy regulations: Consent management helps companies comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and others, which require companies to obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their personal data.
